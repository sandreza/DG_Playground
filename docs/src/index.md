# DG_Playground

A repository for quickly prototyping ideas ideas for the [CLIMA](https://github.com/CliMA/ClimateMachine.jl) project. The main objectives are to
1. Test / develop relevant preconditioners
0. Create useful abstractions for timestepping and DG operators

The core DG algorithm being used here is based on the textbook by [Hesthaven and Warburton](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780387720654).
